### RSS-ECOMM-52: Implement Category Navigation (20 points)

#### Description
Our goal is to make the product exploration process easy and efficient. We need to implement clear and user-friendly navigation that enables users to explore and switch between different product categories or subcategories.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Category Display:** The navigation options should be prominently displayed, possibly as a side panel or a drop-down menu. This might vary depending on the chosen design.
2. **API Usage:** Make use of the commercetools API, or any other simple API, to fetch the categories/subcategories information. The API call should return a list of all available categories/subcategories.
3. **Navigation Implementation:** Each category or subcategory should be clickable, and when clicked, the product list should be updated to reflect the selected category or subcategory.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- User-friendly navigation for product categories and subcategories is implemented and clearly visible.
- Users can switch between different product categories and subcategories.
- Clicking on a category or subcategory updates the product list accordingly.
