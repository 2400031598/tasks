## Sprint 2: Login Page Implementation (80 points)

In the second sprint, the team will focus on implementing the login page, including input validation, integration with an authentication service, managing user authentication state, saving the authentication token, and providing a button to navigate to the registration page. The team's progress will be evaluated through a cross-check process, where other students will assign points based on achieving specific goals and milestones.

### 1. Input Validation (20 points)
- **(10 points)** Implement client-side validation for the login form, including email and password fields. [RSS-ECOMM-22](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-22.md)
- **(10 points)** Display clear error messages indicating any validation issues, such as an improperly formatted email. [RSS-ECOMM-23](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-23.md)

### 2. Integration with Authentication Service (20 points)
- **(10 points)** Integrate the login form with a chosen authentication service (e.g., CommerceTools, Firebase, etc.) to handle user authentication. [RSS-ECOMM-24](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-24.md)
- **(10 points)** Implement error handling for failed authentication attempts, such as incorrect email or password, and display user-friendly error messages. [RSS-ECOMM-25](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-25.md)

### 3. State Management and Redirection (30 points)
- **(10 points)** Maintain user authentication state within the application. [RSS-ECOMM-26](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-26.md)
- **(10 points)** Redirect users to the application's main page upon successful login. [RSS-ECOMM-27](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-27.md)
- **(10 points)** Redirect users who are already logged in to the main page if they try to access the login page. [RSS-ECOMM-28](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-28.md)

### 4. Save Authentication Token (5 points)
- **(5 points)** Save the authentication token securely after a successful login attempt, allowing for seamless user authentication across the application. [RSS-ECOMM-29](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-29.md)

### 5. Navigation to Registration Page (5 points)
- **(5 points)** Add a button or link on the login page that allows users to navigate to the registration page. [RSS-ECOMM-30](./Sprint2/RSS-ECOMM-30.md)

During this sprint, the team of students will implement the login page with form validation, proper error handling, and integration with an authentication service. Additionally, they will maintain user authentication state, saving the authentication token, handle redirections based on login status, and provide a button for navigating to the registration page. The team should regularly communicate their progress, review each other's code, and integrate their work through the version control system (e.g., Git). The project will be evaluated through a cross-check process by other students.
