### RSS-ECOMM-40: Navigation to Login and Registration Pages for Unauthorized Users (10 points)

#### Description
Enable easy navigation for unauthorized users between the login and registration pages. The links or buttons for these pages should be clear, visible, and accessible, following best practices for user interface design. The buttons or links can be implemented in several ways, such as text links, styled buttons, or icons accompanied by labels.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas
1. Text links: Display the links for "Login" and "Register" as underlined text in the header, ensuring good contrast against the background for easy visibility.
2. Styled buttons: Create button elements with consistent background color, hover effect, and typography for the "Login" and "Register" links, making them visually distinct from other elements in the header.
3. Icons with labels: Use recognizable icons (e.g., a key icon for Login and a plus icon for Register) accompanied by labels for each link. Make sure the icon and text are visually connected and have a consistent style.

#### Acceptance Criteria
