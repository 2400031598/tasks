### Implement routing for navigation between login, registration, and main pages (10 points) [RSS-ECOMM-43]

**Description:**  
As a user, I should be able to navigate between the login, registration, and main pages using proper routing. Implement routing using a suitable library or framework (e.g., React Router, Angular Routing) or using an implementation suitable for applications without a specific framework.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Routing for navigation between login, registration, and main pages is implemented.
- Navigation using the implemented routing is smooth, without page refreshes (when applicable, e.g., in a Single Page Application).
- Route transitions are clear, and the user can easily understand the current route within the application.
- Browser history management works as expected (user can navigate forward and backward using browser buttons).
