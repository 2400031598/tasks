### RSS-ECOMM-41: Ability to Access the Main Page for All Users (5 points)

#### Description
Ensure that all users, whether authenticated or not, can access the main page of the application. There should be a clear and visible link or button in the header that allows users to navigate to the main page. The link or button can be implemented in various ways, such as a text link, a styled button, an icon with a label, or even a clickable logo.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas
1. Text link: Display the link for the "Main Page" or "Home" as underlined text in the header, ensuring good contrast against the background for easy visibility.
2. Styled button: Create a button element with a consistent background color, hover effect, and typography for the "Main Page" or "Home" link, making it visually distinct from other elements in the header.
3. Icon with label: Use a recognizable icon (e.g., a home icon) accompanied by a label for the main page link. Ensure that the icon and text are visually connected and have a consistent style.
4. Clickable logo: Make the website's logo in the header clickable, linking it to the main page, with a hover effect indicating its interactivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- A clear and visible link or button to navigate to the main page is present in the header, utilizing one of the visual implementation ideas or another suitable design
- Unauthorized users can access the main page without any restrictions
