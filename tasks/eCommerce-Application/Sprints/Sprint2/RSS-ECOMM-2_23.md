### Implement a 404 (Not Found) page for invalid route requests (10 points) [RSS-ECOMM-45]

**Description:**  
As a user, I should see a 404 (Not Found) page if I try to access an invalid route or a non-existing page within the application. Create a user-friendly 404 page and redirect users to this page when they request an invalid route.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A custom 404 (Not Found) page is designed and implemented, reflecting the application's theme and style.
- The 404 page contains clear messaging informing the user that the requested page could not be found.
- The 404 page includes a navigation option (e.g., a button or link) for users to return to the main page or another accessible section of the application.
- The application automatically redirects users to the 404 page when they request an invalid route.
- The application should maintain the originally requested URL in the browser's address bar when showing the 404 page, as this helps support user expectations and provides clearer context about the requested route.

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Consider adding a search function or a list of popular links on the 404 page to help guide users back to relevant content within the application.
- Implement a simple animation or graphic to visually engage the user and provide a more compelling user experience.
