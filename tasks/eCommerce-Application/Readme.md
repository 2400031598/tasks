## Technology Stack 💻📚

Teams can choose whether or not to use a framework for the project. Options include popular frameworks like React ⚛️, Angular 🅰️, or Vue 🟢. If you prefer, you can also develop the application without using any of these frameworks.

However, there are some constraints on the technology stack:

1. TypeScript is mandatory for this project. It will ensure type safety and improve the maintainability and scalability of the application 📘.
2. jQuery is not allowed. Focus on using modern JavaScript features and APIs, and the capabilities of your chosen framework, rather than relying on jQuery 🚫.
